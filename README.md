## <a id="changelog"></a>Full Changelog (Current version: **0.7.4-stable**)

## 0.7.0-rc [28-05-2025]
- Completely rewrote all of the `EditorWindow` code and most of the C# codebase.
- Completely changed file input/output operations to use asynchronous programming with `async` and `await`, leveraging methods like `File.ReadAllTextAsync` and `File.WriteAllTextAsync` to prevent UI freezing during disk access. This ensures large file loads and saves do not block the main thread, significantly improving user experience.
- Introduced async-based architecture across the app, paving the way for more complex features and performance improvements in future updates.
- While the async implementation added a lot more complexity to the codebase, the overall restructuring of it has made the project significantly more maintainable and scalable. Without the new structure, async would have been a nightmare to manage‚Äînow it's just barely tolerable.
- Implemented an autosave mechanism using a `DispatcherTimer` that triggers asynchronous save operations at regular intervals. This ensures data is backed up in the background without interrupting user interaction or degrading UI responsiveness.
- Significantly improved logging reliability by restructuring the log creation logic, ensuring that exceptions do not prevent critical logs from being recorded.
- Reworked the character counting logic to operate asynchronously in parallel with file I/O. This enables accurate, real-time updates of text statistics even for large documents, without affecting UI performance.
- Fixed issues with `StaticResources` not applying correctly, restoring consistent styling across UI components.
- Added new warnings and UX prompts, such as "Please use Save As first!" and file load confirmations to improve usability and reduce user error.
- Resolved conflicts between UI rendering and background data operations introduced, of course by async logic, ensuring smoother interaction and reduced visual glitches.

#### 0.7.1-rc2[31-05-2025]
- Optimized the codebase using `Lazy` variables and set up lazy-loading config file which improved the boot time from 650-200ms in prod.
- Enriched log output with caller and added more logging events.
- Started preparing for public release, works have started on logs refactoring with separate sink parameters.
- Added 1mb file size limit, will be removed later in development after the addition of serial file loading.
- Removed legacy github link code.

#### 0.7.2-rc3[1-06-2025]
- Added ZenMode functionality and cleaned up some resources.
#### 0.7.3-rc4[1-06-2025]
- Fixed a critical bug that sometimes occured when the async loading method tried to access a non-existant file.
#### 0.7.4-stable[1-06-2025]
- Prepared binary for release, source code has yet to be cleaned up.
- The released binary is completely stable, no known bugs yet.
- Added ZenThemes, to expand later.
- ZenThemes looks for now very crankily, but it is fully stable.
- Begun work on globalizing app messages

## 0.6.0-beta[26-05-2025]
- Designed and implemented a robust global resource architecture using a hybrid of dynamic and static `App.xaml` resources, with all UI variables (colors, spacing, font sizes, etc.) sourced from a centralized JSON configuration at runtime.
- Performed a full UI/UX overhaul including layout restructuring, refined color theming, and improved responsiveness via grid-based adaptive containers and uniform resource bindings.
- Added support for dual logos with an in-app toggle, including a dynamically generated logo system to bypass WPF bitmap limitations.
- Converted all eligible UI components to consume shared static resources, eliminating redundancy and ensuring visual consistency across views.
- Integrated additional system fonts into the application‚Äôs resource context for internal use and improved platform styling fidelity.
- Removed deprecated GitHub titlebar link to streamline interface and reduce non-functional distractions.
- Developed a ‚ÄúNo Recent Files‚Äù detection system to inform users when the recent documents list is empty.
- Fixed a critical bug in the New File logic that caused infinite duplication when triggered without an active document.
- Enhanced application startup with personalized greeting using the current Windows username.
- Simplified and refactored menu code to reduce event handler complexity and improve maintainability.
- Removed redundant constructor arguments from `SettingsWindow`, reducing unnecessary overhead and improving clarity.
- Addressed various minor bugs and inconsistencies across the UI and data logic layers.

#### 0.6.1-beta[26-05-2025]
- Fixed some resources not persisting after clean start
#### 0.6.2-beta[26-05-2025]

#### 0.6.3-beta[27-05-2025]
- Fixed file saving logic route.
## 0.5.0-alpha [25-05-2025]
- Migrated WPF Framework to `MahApps.Metro`, migrating the main window to `MetroWindow` to leverage modern theming, preparing for ui overhaul, extended controls, and a unified UX.  
- Integrated` MahApps.Metro.IconPacks` providing scalable GitHub icons linked to interactive buttons.  
- Implemented `MahApps.Controls` into settings.
- Implemented a `JSON`-Based ConfigManager for persisting user settings automatically (font size, font family) on startup and exit.  
- Integrated Serilog with console and rolling file sinks, including a customized output template for timestamped, leveled, and exception-aware logging.  
- Allocated a debug console dynamically via `kernel32.dll` AllocConsole for enhanced runtime diagnostics.  
- Extended startup diagnostics to capture `.NET` runtime version and memory usage metrics.  
- Refactored startup logic in `App.xaml.cs` to improve modularity and clarity of application initialization.

## 0.4.0-pre-alpha [24-05-2025]
- Implemented core file operations (`Save`, `Load`, `Save As`) in `EditorWindow` using standard WPF file dialogs.
- Integrated Windows `SaveFileDialog` for "Save As" with current file path updating post-save.
- Added autosave mechanism triggered on switching between recent files to minimize data loss risks.
- Developed persistent recent files management via `List<string>` serialized for session retention.
